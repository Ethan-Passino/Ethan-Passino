### ⚡ Fun Fact:
I began my coding journey in 2016 during a high school computer science class where I was introduced to Python. From the start, I was captivated by the possibilities of programming and created various applications, including console-based tools and simple games. The following year, I took AP Computer Science and expanded my skills with Java, where I built several games from scratch. Since then, I've continued to sharpen my programming abilities, exploring new languages, frameworks, and projects.
